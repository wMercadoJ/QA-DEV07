  Scenario Outline: Delete a Story by ID
    Given I have <project_id> of pivotal tracker project to story delete endpoint
    When I have the <story_id> ID of a Story to delete it
    And I send a DELETE request to story endpoint /projects/<project_id>/stories/<story_id>
    Then I should expect the status code 204 to Story delete endpoint

      | 1595957     |120882757   |
